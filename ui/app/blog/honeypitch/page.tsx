          Honeypitch is our deployable deception suite that mimics production APIs and login flows.
          It looks real, it behaves real â€” but it exists only to bait, monitor, and learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          It includes prebuilt admin panels, fake GraphQL endpoints, and RESTful APIs that mirror the behavior
          of common stacks. Attackers fall into the illusion, and we log every move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coupled with visual playback and signature detection, Honeypitch offers unmatched insight into automated recon
          and human-led exploitation attempts.
